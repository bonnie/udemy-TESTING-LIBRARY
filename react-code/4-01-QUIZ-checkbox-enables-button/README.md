## To install

1. If you don't have a project yet, use the `sundae-starter` code at the top level of this repo as a base. **Be sure to run** `npm install` in that directory.
1. Overwrite the `src` directory in your project with the `src` directory here.

**Note** As this is React code for a code quiz, the test code for the React updates is not included (so that you can fill in the tests yourself for the quiz). The tests may not pass with this code as-is.
